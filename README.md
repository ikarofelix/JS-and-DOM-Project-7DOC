# JS and DOM Project 7DOC
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM Project - 7DOC
 
 This is a project made by Ikaro Felix with the ideas and suggestions from a challenge hosted by Alura.

 The project consists of creating a site using sheet to show people's name and birth date, by storing those values on the local storage and being able to access it, edit it and delete it.

 The focus is working with JavaScript and manipulating the DOM.
